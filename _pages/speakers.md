          <p>Yilun Du is an Assistant Professor at Harvard in the Kempner Institute and Computer Science. He was previously a Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind and received his PhD from MIT. His research focuses on generative models, decision making, robot learning, embodied agents, and applications to scientific domains. His research is driven by the goal of developing intelligent embodied agents in the physical world, primarily focusing on building world models using generative AI to enable systematic planning and iterative reasoning. His work has yielded both significant technical contributions (including the development of diffusion models) and advanced foundational understanding of world models across visual generation, scene understanding, and decision-making.</p>
